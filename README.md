## Docker Setup

1. Dockerize the Django project:
   
   - Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project.
   - Define the Docker image and container setup.
   - Optionally, use Docker Compose for multi-container setups.

   docker push <registry-url>/<repository-name>:<tag>
   ```

2. Pull the Docker image on your production server:

   ```bash
   docker pull <registry-url>/<repository-name>:<tag>
